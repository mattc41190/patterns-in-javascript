# patterns-in-javascript
## Introduction
The intent of this repositroy is two-fold. Firstly, it is to learn JavaScript Design Patterns. Secondly, it is to learn the jasmine unit testing framework. To acomplish this I will be using two pieces of documentation. The Introduction Section of the Jasmine JS documentation located [here](http://jasmine.github.io/2.4/introduction.html "Jasmine Documentation") and the book Learning JavaScript Design Patterns by Addy Osmani located free of charge [here](https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/ "JavaScript Design Patterns").

## Method
Each pattern will be emulated from the examples given in the book. The code will be well commented and hopefully relating to the same subject. Each design pattern will be accompanied by a corresponding set of jasmine tests.
